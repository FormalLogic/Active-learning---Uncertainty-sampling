# Active learning 

*Active learning* is a specific approach in machine learning where a a model can achieve better performance with a lower amount of training instances (see Figure below).

A quick presentation of the results can be shown in Figure 2. However for a more detailed explanation of the equations and content, can be found in the notebook *Active learning.ipynb*
